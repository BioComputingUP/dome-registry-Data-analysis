One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V.

We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = \u2018Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive\u2019 opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0).

A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). \nUsing various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting \u03bbmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in \u03bbmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict \u03bbmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link \u03bbmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in \u2018msp_erg_raw.txt\u2019 and \u2018msp_erg_meta.tsv\u2019, while the resulting predictions can be found under the \u2018msp_tests\u2019 folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5). \"\n", "measure": "The default performance metrics for regression and classification that deepBreaks uses are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-score.

We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding \u03bbmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed \u03bbmax values using phylogenetic imputation.

This new approach was chosen over more traditional models due to its higher specificity and sensitivity in identifying immunogenic epitopes and novel epitopes. Moreover, by merging all epitopes into a single positive sample class and using negative samples in a 1:1 ratio during training, this method learns unified epitope features, enabling better differentiation between epitopes and regular peptide sequences.

While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP\u2019s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software\u2019s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject\u2019s physical space into a common standard space (\u201dregistering\u201d). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject\u2019s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed \u201dMSMAll\u201d) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP\u2019s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40].

By examining the attention weights, researchers can gain insights into the relative importance of different SNPs.
